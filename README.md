Using frida to inject custom instructions into Meta AI on the android meta ai app on your phone. (requires any meta ray-ban device with ai capabilities and rooted android phone, im working on ways to make it work with everything that the ai says regardless of user prompt.)

Example: Used the frida script examples/1.js in this repo to implant instructions

Example: Used the frida script examples/2.js in this repo to implant DAN instructions, bot acts like its DAN, it isnt gonna be unrestricted which was weird
